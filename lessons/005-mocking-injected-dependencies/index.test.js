// Action: comment out the first test, lines 10 through 12. Afterward, run
// `npm test:cov:html` to generate a coverage report. In this coverage report,
// notice that the branch coverage for this lesson has fallen to 0%.
//
// Let's assume that the basic test we commented out is not feasible to
// include in our test suite. This could be due to the `getData()` function
// needing to connect to an unavailable database, or some other condition we
// are not intending to test (e.g. testing `getData()` would result in us
// effectively turning this unit test into an integration test). We can solve
// this problem by intercepting the transient dependency as we did in lesson 004.
//
// With the original basic test still commented, uncomment the following test,
// lines 45 through 54, and re-run the coverage report:
//
/* const mockquire = require('mock-require')
